This website is a reproduction of the [Quillbot Grammar Checker](https://quillbot.com/grammar-checker) backed by OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
It is fully functional and can be used to check the grammar and spelling of your text.

If the correction triggers an error, it means I haven't paid my OpenAi bills. Send me money and I'll fix it :)

## How to use
1. Navigate to [grammar-checker.vercel.app](https://grammar-checker.vercel.app/).
2. Enter your text.
3. Click on the "Fix All Errors" button.
4. Wait for the results to appear.

## How it works
The website uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate grammar corrections for your text. The API is called using the [OpenAI Javascript API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview) and the results are displayed on the website.

Developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The design is fully responsive and works on mobile devices.
The UI is based on [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/grammar-checker)'s website.
It includes a dark mode and a light mode. The mode is automatically set based on your device's theme.
There is also a "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the corrected text to your clipboard, as well as an "Undo" button to undo the last correction.
